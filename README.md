For my final project I created a GUI application in Python that allows someone to search for the weather for a city that they have entered. When you run the program, the initial window pops up prompting the user to enter a city name. You then hit the “Search” button to search that city. Once entered, you have the option to end the program there or open a new window next to the initial window to search for another city. This is done with the button “Open New City Entry.” You can open any number of windows until you decide to quit the application. When you search for a city, it displays the city and country where it believes that city to be in. When I search “Greenwood/Franklin” it displays Greenwood, IN and Franklin, IN. When you search “Sydney” it displays “Sydney AU.” Moscow shows “Moscow, RU.” Along with the city and country the application also displays the temperature in Celsius and Fahrenheit as well as the weather conditions such as whether it is cloudy or sunny.
